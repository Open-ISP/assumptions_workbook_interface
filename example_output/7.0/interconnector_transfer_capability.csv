"NSW – QLD (""QNI"")",950,950,950,1450,1450,1450,QNI forward direction maximum transfer capacity of 950 MW (design limit with QNI minor).,Thermal capacity of Sapphire-Armidale 330 kV line for an outage of Dumaresq-Armidale 330 kV line. This assumes no Sapphire wind and/or Tilbuster solar generation.,These transfer limits include the completion of the QNI minor project. QNI minor is currently undergoing inter-network testing to release the designed maximum capacity. QLD to NSW transfer limit influenced by generation output from Sapphire wind farm and Tilbuster Solar Farm. AEMO is working with Transgrid to further refine this limit for the Final 2025 IASR.
NNSW – SQ (“Terranora”),0,50,50,130,150,200,Thermal capability of Lismore 132kV lines (9U9).,Thermal capability of Mudgeeraba 275/110 kV transformers,Thermal capability of Mudgeeraba 275/110 kV transformers
VIC – NSW,870,1000,1000,400,400,400,Transient stability for a fault on a Hazelwood-South 500 circuit or volage stability in Southern New South Wales for loss of largest load in Victoria.,Voltage stability in SNSW for loss of the largest generator in Victoria.,For peak demand limit in reverse direction - Victoria System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) with 250 MW battery storage in western side of Melbourne raises the thermal capacity of Victoria-New South Wales interconnector. WNV - SNSW transfer limit during peak periods reduces to 250 MW on conclusion of the VNI SIPS agreement 31 March 2032.
VIC – SESA (“Heywood”),650,650,650,650,650,650,Thermal capacity of Heywood-South East 275 kV line or transient stability limit for loss of the largest generator in South Australia or transient stability limit of loss of South East - Tailem Bend 275 kV line.,Oscillatory stability limit.,Oscillatory stability limit.
NSW-SA (Project EnergyConnect Stage 1),150,150,150,150,150,150,Project Energy Connect Stage 1 design limit.,Project Energy Connect design limit.,VIC-SA (Heywood) and NSW-SA combined maximum transfer limit is 750 MW in forward direction (import into SA) and 700 MW in reverse direction (export from SA). This transfer limit will increase with full capacity release of Project Energy Connect (Stage 2 completion). Additional transfer capacity is provided in a table below titled 'Notional transfer capability uplift between the sub-regions for committed and anticipated projects'.
"VIC – CSA (""Murraylink"")",165,220,220,100,200,200,Murraylink thermal capacity. Assumes high renewable generation in North West Victoria during high ambient temperature.,Thermal capability of 132 kV lines between Robertstown and North West Bend,Thermal capability of 132 kV lines between Robertstown and North West Bend
TAS – VIC,594,594,594,478,478,478,Basslink HVDC submarine cable transfer limit.,Basslink HVDC submarine cable transfer limit.,"The TAS - VIC (Basslink) allowable capability is limited by a daily energy throughput limit, as outlined in the table below. APA has advised AEMO of a new Cable Load Prediction System (CLPS) for Basslink that allows for this dynamic capacity on this existing cable between Tasmania and Victoria, increasing peak transfer capacity to its original design transfer capacity (594 MW towards Victoria and 478 MW towards Tasmania).
